Hello world !


This a little drill to display a Gui window with wxPython.

Nothing amazing it gives you the basics to start with your own Gui it shows you how to open the window , create buttons and finally 
create the menu with an exit subfile that exits when you click on it.

Feel free to fork to the repo or go ahead and check my other repos.

Thank you,

Hamza
